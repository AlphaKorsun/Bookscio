/*
 * C# includes static keyword just like other programming languages such as C++, 
 * Java, etc. The static keyword can be applied on classes, variables, methods, 
 * properties, operators, events and constructors. However, it cannot be used with 
 * indexers, destructors or types other than classes.
 * The static modifier makes an item non-instantiable, it means the static item 
 * cannot be instantiated. If the static modifier is applied to a class then that 
 * class cannot be instantiated using the new keyword. If the static modifier is 
 * applied to a variable, method or property of class then they can be accessed without
 * creating an object of the class, just use className.propertyName, className.methodName.
